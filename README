This README is for a Windows version of the script.

HOPS (Hosts from Putty Sessions) can generate hosts file base on your putty config in Windows registry.
As usual, there are some restrictions applied:

- needed modules:

    Win32;
    Win32::TieRegistry;

- you MUST have perl installed. Active State or Strawberry Perl should be fine.
- you also have to manually edit the script and edit the 'user specific' section at the beginning of the script:

    my $hostsfile = "path/to/hosts";

- your Putty sessions MUST conform to these rules:

    hostname (IP address) username [...]

    for e.g. localhost (127.0.0.1) oracle

    Otherwise it won't get picked to be processed into the hosts file.
    If username is omitted that will happen too.

- there also should be a "# Oracle" section in your hosts file, like this:

    # Oracle
    ... hosts go here ...
